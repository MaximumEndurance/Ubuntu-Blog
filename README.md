## Part 1:Creating A Live USB drive

1. Download Ubuntu version ~16. [Click Here](releases.ubuntu.com/16.04.1/ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso?_ga=1.267151886.1068213053.1475231553) to download Ubuntu. 
3. Now download Universal USB Installer(UUI). This will create a live USB. Directly booting from the ISO file (that we downloaded is not possible). Link for downloading UUI
	[Download UUI](https://www.pendrivelinux.com/downloads/Universal-USB-Installer/Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.7.0.exe)
4. Install UUI.
5. Select the linux distro, here Ubuntu.
6. In the link for download location  choose the location of the ubuntu file downloaded (lies probably in your Downloads directory).
7. Select the drive letter (E, F ,G etc) of the pendrive that you inserted 
	Note: Attempt this step with caution and verify the drive letter carefully.  
8. A typical conversion to live USB may take 15-30 minutes.

Part 1 complete. Congrats!

## Part 2:Booting into Ubuntu

1. From the Start screen search for Update and Recovery --> Advanced Startup Options --> Restart Now.
2. A blue colored screen opens now.
3. Choose "Use a USB device"
4. Then select your device (preferrably knowing the brand of pen drive would work)

Part 2 complete: You are now booting into Ubuntu

## Part 3: Installing Ubuntu

1. We notice that a black screen appears with 4 options.
Choose "Try Ubuntu without installing". 
Note: it is not in best practise to go for "install Ubuntu" directly and better to first check if our system is capable og booting into it.
2. One violet screen later you boot into the Ubuntu Desktop.
3. Tap the second icon "Install Ubuntu 16.10" (version may be different).
4. Now might be the best time to connect to the Internet. Ubuntu depends on several third-party softwares (softwares sourced out of Ubuntu) so trust it, its worthwhile to connect to the Internet.
-------------If using Internet requires logging into then
: Launch Firefox (from the left side vertical bar you see --> Go to university URL and login) )

Part 3 complete : Installation window opens up.

## Part 4: Selecting right options while installing

For most of the part you will have to go on clicking next, next and next here.

Here it is recommended that you check the options for "Installing updates" as well as "Installing third party software".
Leave the "Turn off Secure Boot" option disabled for now.

1. Be careful with the second window though.

	You will have 2 options:
	
	a) Choose to install alongside Windows Boot Manager
	b) Erase disk and install Ubuntu
	
	Choose a)
	Note: If you choose b) you will end up  format your hard disk and wipe out Windows.
	
2. For choosing time instead of the default Kolkata, search for India time. India time is regularly matched the Internet time, so saves you the horrors of updating time again.

3. In the window for partitions, assign a size of 70-100GB for Ubuntu (it will last you for quite a while). Use the slider in the middle to adjust the partitions.

_Ubuntu stands for "I am what I am because of what we are"_
